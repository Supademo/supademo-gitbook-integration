  # Overview

  With Supademo, you can easily make interactive product demos in just minutes. It helps turn all users into experts by allowing them to experience your product through interactive and guided demos.

  This integration allows you to embed Supademo interactive demos into your GitBook documentation.

  # How it works

  Embedding a Supademo in your documentation is simple - just paste your Supademo link into the GitBook editor. The app will turn the link into a Supademo embed showing your recorded demo.

  # Configure

  To install on a single space navigate to integrations in sub-navigation. If you prefer to install the Supademo integration on multiple or all spaces, navigate to your organization settings and enable it from the integrations panel. This will give you access to the custom Supademo block.
